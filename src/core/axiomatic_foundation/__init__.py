Axiomatic Foundation Module
==========================

This module establishes a formal, verifiable, and self-consistent foundation 
for Kimera's cognitive processes based on rigorous mathematical principles.

The axiomatic foundation provides:
- Mathematical proof systems for cognitive operations
- Axiom of Understanding implementation
- Continuous verification and validation
- Counter-example search mechanisms

Scientific Basis:
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems
- Formal verification methods from aerospace engineering
- Mathematical logic and proof theory
- Type theory and category theory foundations

- Hoare, C.A.R. (1969). "An axiomatic basis for computer programming"
