Context Imposer for KIMERA SWM
==============================

Author: Idir Ben Slama
Cognitive Simplification: 3B
Date: 2025-06-20

Purpose:
To fulfill the user's core insight: KIMERA needs to be aware of the "goal and purpose" of a module before it speaks. This module provides that awareness.

Analogy:
If the Universal Translator is a mouth, the Context Imposer is the part of the brain that decides *what persona* to adopt before speaking. Is it a scientist? A philosopher? A compassionate guide? The context of the conversation dictates the persona.

Methodology:
The ContextImposer class analyzes a given context (e.g., the module initiating a request) and constructs a "persona prompt". This prompt is a piece of text prepended to the user's actual query, framing the AI's response in a way that is consistent with the module's function. This ensures "Cognitive Fidelity" is maintained across all interactions.
