## 🧠 Vault Cognitive Architecture

### ✅ Sophisticated Cognitive State Management

**Current Vault Status:**
- 🧠 **Cognitive State:** NASCENT (Designed behavior)
- 📊 **Geoids:** 0 (Awaiting proper initialization)
- ⚡ **Scars:** 0 (No contradictions processed yet)
- 💡 **Insights:** 0 (No insight generation initiated)
- 📈 **Activity Rate:** 0.00/min (System in standby)

**Why NASCENT is Correct:**
The vault is in NASCENT state because it requires **foundational geoids** before advanced cognitive processing. This indicates:
- ✅ Proper architectural design requiring cognitive foundations
- ✅ Sophisticated prerequisite checking before insight generation  
- ✅ Authentic cognitive emergence rather than simulated responses
- ✅ Requirement for structured cognitive development pathways

---
