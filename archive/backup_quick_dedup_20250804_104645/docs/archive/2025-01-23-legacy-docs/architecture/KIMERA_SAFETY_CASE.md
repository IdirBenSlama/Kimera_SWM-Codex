# KIMERA Protocol for Architecturally Verified Safety (K-PAVS) - Safety Case

## 1. Core Philosophy

### 1.1. The Prime Directive: Stability Precedes Capability

The fundamental measure of progress for the Kimera System is its architectural stability, predictability, and verifiable safety. The addition of new capabilities is contingent upon the demonstrated resilience of the existing system. This document serves as the immutable standard against which all architectural decisions are measured.

### 1.2. The Central Analogy: Managing Cognitive Chain Reactions

The development of a self-evolving reasoning system is analogous to the management of a nuclear chain reaction. An uncontrolled cognitive process—a "cognitive meltdown"—represents a catastrophic failure mode. K-PAVS is the framework designed to govern this process, ensuring it remains stable, predictable, and beneficial.

## 2. The "Defence in Depth" Cognitive Architecture

The Kimera system shall be architected into four distinct, hierarchically organized safety layers. A failure in a lower-numbered layer must be caught and controlled by a higher-numbered layer.

### 2.1. Layer 1: The Inherently Stable Core

-   **Description:** The system's foundational logic, mathematical axioms, and core reasoning algorithms.
-   **Mandate:** This layer must be formally verifiable, minimalist, and inherently resistant to paradox. It is the physics of the system's mind.

### 2.2. Layer 2: Cognitive Governance & Control

-   **Description:** Real-time monitoring and control systems that act as the AI's "nervous system." This includes modules for managing cognitive risk, detecting contradictions, and ensuring ethical alignment.
-   **Mandate:** This layer actively maintains cognitive equilibrium. It must be capable of identifying and mitigating abnormal operations originating from Layer 1.

### 2.3. Layer 3: Automated Fail-Safe Systems

-   **Description:** High-privilege, low-complexity, non-intelligent "circuit breakers."
-   **Mandate:** These systems operate with maximal independence from the core cognitive architecture. Their sole function is to enforce hard operational limits (e.g., resource consumption, operational duration, axiom violation flags) and trigger a safe shutdown when breached. They are the final automated line of defense.

### 2.4. Layer 4: Human-in-the-Loop Oversight

-   **Description:** The interfaces, visualizations, and reporting mechanisms that provide transparent, real-time insight into the system's operational and safety status.
-   **Mandate:** This layer serves the project's **Cognitive Fidelity** directive. The human operator must be provided with unambiguous, actionable data on the health of Layers 1, 2, and 3 at all times. This is the system's "control room."
