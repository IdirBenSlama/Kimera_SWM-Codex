## Introduction for Implementation AI

Your function is to execute the tasks outlined in this document sequentially. You are to interpret these instructions with maximum literalness and engineering rigor. Before executing each task, you must state the task ID and its objective. Upon completion, you must report on the specific verification steps you have taken to validate the outcome. All code you produce must be of production quality, fully documented, and type-hinted.

Your prime directive is to adhere to the principles defined in `docs/architecture/KIMERA_SAFETY_CASE.md`. This roadmap is the sole source of truth for your work.

## Phase 0: Foundational Stability & System Reconnaissance

**Objective:** To establish a stable, deterministic foundation for all future work and to build a complete architectural map of the existing system.

### **Task 0.1: Remediate Non-Deterministic Dependencies**
-   **Status:** `COMPLETED` by Lead Architect.
-   **Objective:** To eliminate runtime instability introduced by floating dependencies.
-   **Action:** The `requirements/base.txt` file was analyzed. All direct and transitive dependencies were resolved to their exact versions and pinned using the `==` operator.
-   **Verification:** The `requirements/base.txt` file is now a fully deterministic manifest. Any environment created from this file will be identical, ensuring reproducibility.

### **Task 0.2: Full Codebase Cartography**
-   **Status:** `PENDING`
-   **Objective:** To create a comprehensive map of all modules, functions, classes, and their inter-dependencies within the `backend/` directory.
-   **Guiding Principle:** (Layer 4) You cannot ensure safety without complete system visibility.
-   **Instructions for Implementer:**
    1.  You will perform a static analysis of the entire `backend/` codebase.
    2.  You will generate a dependency graph that maps all module-level imports.
    3.  You will identify and list all circular dependencies. A circular dependency is a critical architectural flaw that impedes stability and must be eliminated.
    4.  You will create a new file, `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`, and output your findings there in Markdown format. Use Mermaid syntax for the graph visualization.

### **Task 0.3: Remediate Refactoring Anomaly**
-   **Status:** `PENDING`
-   **Objective:** To manually correct the import statement in `backend/optimization/automated_tcse_tuner.py`.
-   **Guiding Principle:** Do not repeat a failed process. When automated tooling fails, escalate to a more direct method.
-   **Description:** The automated refactoring for `automated_tcse_tuner.py` failed three consecutive times, indicating an unstable interaction with the file editing tool. The refactoring of this specific file was halted to prevent corruption. This task is to manually construct and apply the correct file content.

## Phase 1: Defence in Depth - Architectural Layering

**Objective:** To physically and logically restructure the codebase to reflect the K-PAVS multi-layer safety architecture.

### **Task 1.1: Create Layered Directory Structure**
-   **Status:** `PENDING`
-   **Objective:** To create the physical directory structure that will house the layered components.
-   **Guiding Principle:** Architectural intent must be reflected in the physical layout of the code.
-   **Instructions for Implementer:**
    1.  Within the `backend/` directory, create the following new package directories:
        -   `layer_1_core/`
        -   `layer_2_governance/`
        -   `layer_3_failsafes/`
        -   `layer_4_interface/`
    2.  Ensure each new directory contains an empty `__init__.py` file to mark it as a Python package.
    3.  Verify the creation of these directories and their `__init__.py` files.

### **Task 1.2: Relocate Core Modules**
-   **Status:** `PENDING`
-   **Objective:** To begin populating the new architectural layers with existing components.
-   **Guiding Principle:** Isolate critical components within their designated safety layers.
-   **Instructions for Implementer:**
    1.  **Analyze:** Identify the modules that belong to Layer 2 (Cognitive Governance). Based on initial reconnaissance, these are `backend/governance/`, `backend/security/`, and `backend/monitoring/`.
    2.  **Move:** Relocate the contents of these directories into `backend/layer_2_governance/`.
    3.  **Refactor Imports:** Systematically scan the entire codebase and update all `import` statements that are now broken due to the file moves. This is a critical step requiring 100% accuracy.
    4.  **Validate:** Run the system's test suite to ensure that the refactoring has not broken any existing functionality. All tests must pass before this task is considered complete.

### **Task 1.3: Remediate Refactoring Anomaly**
-   **Status:** `PENDING`
-   **Objective:** To manually correct the import statement in `backend/optimization/automated_tcse_tuner.py`.
-   **Guiding Principle:** Do not repeat a failed process. When automated tooling fails, escalate to a more direct method.
-   **Description:** The automated refactoring for `automated_tcse_tuner.py` failed three consecutive times, indicating an unstable interaction with the file editing tool. The refactoring of this specific file was halted to prevent corruption. This task is to manually construct and apply the correct file content.

## Phase 2: Hardening & Formalization

**Objective:** To apply a higher standard of rigor to the system's most critical components.
*(Further tasks to be defined upon completion of Phase 1)*

---

## Phase 3: Adversarial Testing & Validation

**Objective:** To build a framework for actively trying to break the system's safety guarantees.
*(Further tasks to be defined upon completion of Phase 2)*
