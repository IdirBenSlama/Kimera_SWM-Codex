# Kimera SWM Autonomous AI Trading System: Granular Roadmap & Enhancement Plan

---

## 0. Context & Cognitive Alignment

- **Project:** End-to-End Autonomous AI Trading System for Kimera SWM
- **Philosophy:** Cognitive fidelity, neurodivergent context-sensitivity, multi-perspectival/analogy-driven reasoning, visual/graphical thinking ([see `kimera_ai_reference.md`])
- **Objective:** Real, robust, explainable, and adaptive trading system operating on live data, with full feedback and scientific falsifiability.
- **Stakeholders:** Lead developer (Idir Ben Slama), Kimera core team, compliance/security, end-users.
- **Architectural Blueprint:** See [`Autonomous AI Trading System Refinement.md`](../backend/trading/source/Autonomous%20AI%20Trading%20System%20Refinement.md) for rationale on modular monolith, multi-agent AI, and advanced validation.
