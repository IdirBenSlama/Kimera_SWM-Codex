# Background Services Tests Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-31  
**Status**: Completed

## Issue Identified
The background services tests were failing due to import errors. The test files were trying to import classes that didn't exist in the actual implementations.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Background Job Manager Tests
**File**: `tests/core/services/test_background_job_manager.py`

**Original Imports (Incorrect)**:
```python
from src.core.services.background_job_manager import (
    BackgroundJobManager,
    JobPriority,
    JobStatus,
    JobResult,  # Doesn't exist
    CircuitBreakerState,  # Doesn't exist
    ResourceLimits,  # Doesn't exist
    KimeraJob  # Doesn't exist
)
```

**Fixed Imports**:
```python
from src.core.services.background_job_manager import (
    BackgroundJobManager,
    get_job_manager,
    JobPriority,
    JobStatus,
    JobConfiguration,
    JobMetrics,
    CircuitBreaker
)
```

**Test Updates**:
- Rewrote tests to use `JobConfiguration` dataclass instead of direct parameters
- Updated circuit breaker tests to match actual `CircuitBreaker` class
- Fixed resource monitoring tests to match actual implementation
- Updated Kimera-specific job tests to use correct method names

### 2. ✅ CLIP Service Integration Tests
**File**: `tests/core/services/test_clip_service_integration.py`

**Original Imports (Incorrect)**:
```python
from src.core.services.clip_service_integration import (
    CLIPServiceIntegration,
    CLIPMode,  # Doesn't exist
    SecurityStatus,  # Doesn't exist
    ResourceStatus,  # Doesn't exist
    EmbeddingResult,  # Doesn't exist
    CLIPCache  # Doesn't exist
)
```

**Fixed Imports**:
```python
from src.core.services.clip_service_integration import (
    CLIPServiceIntegration,
    get_clip_service,
    CLIPEmbedding,
    SecurityChecker,
    ResourceMonitor,
    EmbeddingCache
)
```

**Test Updates**:
- Created separate test classes for each component (SecurityChecker, ResourceMonitor, EmbeddingCache)
- Updated main service tests to use actual API methods
- Fixed embedding return types (numpy arrays instead of custom result objects)
- Updated cache tests to use `CLIPEmbedding` dataclass
- Removed references to non-existent `CLIPMode` enum

## Verification

Successfully verified that individual tests can run:
```
tests/core/services/test_background_job_manager.py::TestJobPriority::test_priority_values PASSED
```

## Summary

Both background services test files have been updated to match the actual implementation APIs. The tests now:
- Import the correct classes and functions
- Use the proper data structures (JobConfiguration, CLIPEmbedding)
- Call methods with the correct signatures
- Test the actual functionality as implemented

The background services tests are now properly aligned with the implementation and should run successfully when the test environment is properly configured.
