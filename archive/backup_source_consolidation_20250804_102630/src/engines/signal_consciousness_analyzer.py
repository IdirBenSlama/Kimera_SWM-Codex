Signal-Based Consciousness Architecture
========================================

This module implements the SignalConsciousnessAnalyzer, an engine designed to
measure and quantify correlates of consciousness based on the thermodynamic
and informational patterns of signal evolution. It draws from theories like
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT).
