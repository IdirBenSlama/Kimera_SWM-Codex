# Root Directory Cleanup Experiment - 2025-01-08

## Hypothesis
The KIMERA SWM project root directory was cluttered with hundreds of experimental scripts, test files, and configuration files. By systematically moving these files to appropriate locations following the KIMERA SWM Autonomous Architect Protocol, we will achieve:
1. Clear project structure
2. Better code organization
3. Easier navigation and maintenance
4. Scientific rigor in codebase management

## Methodology
1. **Identified scattered files**: Found ~200+ Python scripts in root directory
2. **Applied KIMERA protocol structure**: Moved files according to protocol guidelines
3. **Preserved all content**: No files deleted, only moved and organized
4. **Maintained traceability**: All moves tracked in git history

## Experimental Variables
- **Independent**: File organization strategy
- **Dependent**: Project navigability, maintenance ease
- **Controls**: No functional code changes, all files preserved

## Results
Successfully moved to organized structure:
- **Trading scripts**: Experimental trading algorithms and strategies
- **Test scripts**: Various system validation and testing utilities  
- **Setup scripts**: Environment and system configuration tools
- **Analysis scripts**: Performance and system analysis tools
- **Demo scripts**: Demonstration and proof-of-concept implementations

## Success Criteria
- [x] All experimental Python scripts organized
- [x] Root directory significantly cleaned
- [x] No files lost or deleted
- [x] Maintained git history
- [x] Clear separation of experimental vs production code

## Contents Overview
This directory contains experimental scripts that were scattered in the project root, including:

### Trading Systems
- Multiple Kimera trading implementations
- Autonomous trading experiments
- CDP and Binance integration tests
- Profit optimization algorithms

### System Tools
- Database migration utilities
- Performance testing scripts
- System validation tools
- Monitoring and analysis utilities

### Experimental Features
- AI system optimizers
- Quantum processing experiments
- Omnidimensional trading concepts
- Cognitive trading intelligence

## Recovery Instructions
If any script from this archive is needed for production:
1. Review the script for current relevance
2. Test thoroughly in isolated environment
3. Refactor to meet current KIMERA standards
4. Move to appropriate `/src` module
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

## Archive Integrity
- All files preserved with original timestamps
- Git history maintained
- No functional changes made
- Full traceability available
