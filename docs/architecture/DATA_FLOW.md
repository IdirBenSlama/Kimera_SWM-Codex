### 5. Risk Management Flow

```
Multiple Inputs → Risk Assessment Engine → Risk Metrics
                        ↓
Position Sizing ← Risk Allocation ← Energy Conservation
                        ↓
Self-Healing ← Adaptive Adjustment ← System Health Monitoring
                        ↓
Risk Reporting ← Performance Analysis ← Historical Validation
```

## Data Storage and Persistence

### Storage Layers

1. **Real-time Cache**: In-memory storage for immediate access
2. **Operational Database**: Current state and recent history
3. **Analytical Warehouse**: Historical data for deep analysis
4. **Archive Storage**: Long-term retention and compliance

### Data Models

  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "symbol": "trading pair identifier",
  "price": "decimal value",
  "volume": "decimal value",
  "entropy": "calculated entropy value",
  "consciousness_level": "current awareness state",
  "quantum_state": "quantum state representation",
  "energy_level": "thermodynamic energy measure"
}
```

#### Decision Record Model
