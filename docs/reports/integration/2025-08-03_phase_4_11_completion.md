### Executive Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Phase**: 4.11  
**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**  
**Standard**: DO-178C Level A (Catastrophic Failure Condition)

   - GPU-accelerated pattern matching

2. **System 2 Processor** (`system2.py`)
   - Deliberative, analytical reasoning
   - Logical inference engine with multiple reasoning types
   - Causal model construction
   - Response time: < 1000ms

3. **Metacognitive Controller** (`metacognitive.py`)
   - Arbitration between systems
   - Confidence-based, context-aware, and hybrid strategies
   - Performance monitoring and adaptation
   - Response time: < 50ms

4. **Unified Integration Engine** (`unified_engine.py`)
   - Orchestrates dual-system processing
   - Multiple processing modes (parallel, sequential, system-preferred)
   - DO-178C compliant safety monitoring

### 1.2 Key Features Implemented

## 3. Issues Resolved

### 3.1 Logger Configuration
- **Issue**: Missing `LogCategory.DUAL_SYSTEM`
- **Fix**: Added DUAL_SYSTEM to LogCategory enum in `kimera_logger.py`

### 3.2 Database Schema
- **Issue**: Invalid field `last_updated` in SelfModelDB
- **Fix**: Removed non-existent field from instantiation

### 3.3 Missing Methods
- **Issue**: LogicalReasoner missing `_analogy` and `_induction` methods
- **Fix**: Implemented both methods with appropriate reasoning logic

### 3.4 Performance Monitor
- **Issue**: Incorrect method name `measure` (should be `profile`)
- **Fix**: Updated to use correct method name

### 3.5 Arbitration Strategy
- **Issue**: None value causing validation error
- **Fix**: Added default fallback to CONFIDENCE_BASED strategy

### 3.6 System 1 Timing
- **Issue**: Exceeding 100ms limit due to thread pool overhead
- **Fix**: Implemented fast-path for small inputs, avoiding thread pool
