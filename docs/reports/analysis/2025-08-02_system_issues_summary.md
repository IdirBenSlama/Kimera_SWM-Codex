## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **Health Endpoint 500 Error**
The `/health` endpoint failure appears to be caused by:
1. **Undefined Variable**: `unified_architecture` variable not in scope
2. **Import Issues**: Potential missing imports in main.py
3. **Exception Handling**: Uncaught exceptions in health check logic
4. **Dependency Initialization**: Systems not properly initialized

### **Code Quality Issues**
The massive number of style issues (95,122) indicates:
1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Mixed coding standards
2. **Long Lines**: Lines exceeding recommended length
3. **Trailing Whitespace**: Basic formatting issues
4. **Complex Functions**: Functions with high cyclomatic complexity

### **Technical Debt Accumulation**
High debt score (14,613) suggests:
1. **Deferred Maintenance**: Many TODO items left unresolved
2. **Deprecated Patterns**: Old code patterns not updated
3. **Quick Fixes**: Temporary solutions that became permanent
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Missing or outdated documentation

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Next 24 hours)**
1. **Fix Health Endpoint**
   - Debug and resolve the 500 error in `/health`

   - Fix basic style violations
   - Establish coding standards

2. **Complexity Reduction**
   - Refactor high-complexity functions
   - Break down monolithic functions
   - Improve code organization

### **Phase 3: Technical Debt (Next Month)**
