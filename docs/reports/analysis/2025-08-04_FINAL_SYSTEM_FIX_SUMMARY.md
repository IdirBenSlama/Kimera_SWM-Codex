## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Memory Management**
```python
# Before: Unbounded accumulation
self.performance_history.append(metrics)  # Memory leak!

# After: Circular buffer with cleanup
self.performance_history.append(metrics)
if len(self.performance_history) > 3600:
    self.performance_history = self.performance_history[-3600:]
```

### **Database Configuration**
```python
# Before: Multiple conflicting managers
from src.vault.database import engine1
from src.vault.database_connection_manager import engine2  
from src.vault.enhanced_database_schema import engine3

# After: Unified configuration
from src.config.database_config import db_config
engine = db_config.get_engine()  # Single source of truth
```

### **API Settings Robustness**
```python
# Before: Fragile imports
from src.utils.config import get_api_settings  # Could fail

# After: Robust with fallbacks
from src.utils.robust_config import get_api_settings
# Includes automatic fallbacks and error handling
```
