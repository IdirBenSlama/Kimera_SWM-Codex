    def __init__(self):
        self.safety_monitor = SafetyMonitor()
        self.formal_verifier = FormalVerifier()
        self.requirement_tracer = RequirementTracer()
        
    def execute_with_verification(self, operation: Callable) -> Result:
        """Execute operation with full DO-178C compliance"""
        # Pre-condition verification
        self.verify_preconditions()
        
        # Formal proof generation
        proof = self.formal_verifier.generate_proof(operation)
        
        # Safety barrier check
        safety_assessment = self.safety_monitor.assess_operation(operation)
        
        if not (proof.valid and safety_assessment.safe):
            return Result.SAFETY_ABORT
            
        # Execute with monitoring
        result = self.monitored_execution(operation)
        
        # Post-condition verification
        self.verify_postconditions(result)
        
        return result
