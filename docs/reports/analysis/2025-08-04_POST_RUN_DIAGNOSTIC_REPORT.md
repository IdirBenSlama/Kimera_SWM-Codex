## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES - TARGETED FIXES NEEDED**

### 1. **Memory Leak Persistence** 🧠
**Issue**: GPUPerformanceMetrics accumulation continues
```
📊 Before Run: 103 objects
📊 After 6min:  122 objects  
📊 Growth Rate: ~3 objects/minute
```

**Root Cause**: Our circular buffer fix needs to be applied more comprehensively

**Immediate Action Required**:
- Apply memory leak fixes to the specific active components
- Implement runtime cleanup triggers
- Add automatic garbage collection cycles

### 2. **API Settings Import Failure** 📦
**Issue**: signal_consciousness_analyzer still failing to load robust config
```
⚠️ "Failed to load API settings: name 'get_api_settings' is not defined"
```

**Root Cause**: Import path not updated in this specific module

**Fix Required**: Update signal_consciousness_analyzer.py import

### 3. **Database Authentication Failure** 🗄️
**Issue**: PostgreSQL authentication failing
```
❌ "password authentication failed for user 'kimera_user'"
```

**Root Cause**: Database credentials or setup incomplete

**Options**:
- Fix PostgreSQL setup with correct credentials
- Switch to SQLite fallback for development
- Update unified database config with proper auth

### 4. **Engine Initialization Incomplete** ⚙️
**Status**: Some engines not reaching full operational state
```
⚠️ Heat pump not fully initialized
⚠️ Maxwell demon not fully initialized  
⚠️ Consciousness detector not fully initialized
```

**Analysis**: Engines initialize but don't pass full validation checks
