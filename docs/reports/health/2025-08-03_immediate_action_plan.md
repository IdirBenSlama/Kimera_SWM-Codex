# KIMERA SWM IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN
**Status**: CRITICAL SYSTEM RECOVERY REQUIRED
**Priority**: P0 - IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION

---

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ACTIONS (Execute Immediately)

### 1. GPU Monitoring Fix
**Target**: `src/core/kimera_system` lines 1014-1015
```python
# ISSUE: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression
# LOCATION: GPU monitoring startup
# ACTION: Fix async context management
```

### 2. API Settings Import Resolution  
**Target**: Multiple modules importing `get_api_settings`
```python
# ISSUE: name 'get_api_settings' is not defined
# LOCATION: 50+ modules across engines/
# ACTION: Verify import paths in src/utils/config.py
```

### 3. Thermodynamic Engine Recovery
**Target**: All thermodynamic engines
```python
# ISSUE: Empty operation history causing 0.000 efficiency
# LOCATION: Heat pump, Maxwell demon, consciousness detector
# ACTION: Initialize with baseline operations
```

### 4. Memory Leak Cleanup
**Target**: System-wide resource management
```python
# ISSUE: 217 leaked objects (ThermodynamicState + GPUPerformanceMetrics)
# LOCATION: Memory management subsystems
# ACTION: Implement immediate cleanup cycles
```

---

## âš¡ RECOVERY SEQUENCE

```bash
# 1. Diagnose specific GPU monitoring issue
grep -r "await.*None" src/core/

# 2. Fix API settings imports  
python -c "from src.utils.config import get_api_settings; print('Import OK')"

# 3. Run thermodynamic recovery
python scripts/health_check/emergency_thermodynamic_diagnosis.py

# 4. Monitor memory usage
python -c "import gc; gc.collect(); print('Cleanup complete')"
```

---

## ðŸ“Š SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] GPU monitoring starts without errors
- [ ] Thermodynamic efficiency > 0.85  
- [ ] Memory leaks < 5 objects
- [ ] All engines fully initialized
- [ ] System health: "transcendent"

---

**Next Steps**: Execute recovery protocol and validate system stability.
