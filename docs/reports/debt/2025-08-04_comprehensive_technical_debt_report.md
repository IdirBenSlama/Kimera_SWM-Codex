## Appendix: Detailed Debt Inventory

### Strategic Debt Justification

The large files in `src/core/enhanced_capabilities/` and `src/engines/` represent sophisticated domain logic that **should remain consolidated** due to:

1. **Complex interdependencies** requiring cohesive implementation
2. **Domain expertise concentration** enabling specialized optimization
3. **Performance considerations** minimizing cross-module communication
4. **Scientific accuracy** maintaining mathematical/algorithmic integrity

### Emergency Action Items (This Week)

1. **Execute file relocation script**
2. **Resolve 5 critical TODO items**
3. **Document architectural decision rationale**
4. **Schedule team training sessions**
5. **Establish debt monitoring dashboard**

**Next Review:** August 11, 2025  
**Escalation Path:** Project Lead → Technical Advisory Board → Executive Sponsor
