```

## Usage

Configuration files are automatically loaded based on the environment:

```python
from config_loader import load_config

# Load environment-specific config
config = load_config('development')

# Load specific component config
db_config = load_config('database')
```

## Environment Management

- **Development**: Local development settings
- **Testing**: Test suite configurations
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live system settings

## Quality Standards

All configuration files:
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include validation schemas where applicable
- Are version controlled
- Include documentation comments
