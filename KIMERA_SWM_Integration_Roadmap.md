*   **Transparency**: The integration process will be fully transparent, with clear documentation and justifications for all architectural decisions.
*   **Modularity and Cohesion**: Engines will be integrated in a modular fashion, but with high cohesion to the core system, ensuring a unified and consistent architecture.
*   **Robustness and Reliability**: The system will be designed and tested to the highest standards of robustness and reliability, drawing inspiration from mission-critical systems in aerospace and nuclear engineering.
*   **No Mocks, No Simulations**: All testing and validation will be conducted with real data and in a real-world operational environment.

## 3. Integration Phases

1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Analysis and Design (Weeks 1-2)**
    *   Deep dive into the source code of each missing engine.
    *   Identify all dependencies and potential conflicts.
    *   Design a detailed integration plan for each engine.
2.  **Phase 2: Core Integration (Weeks 3-8)**
    *   Integrate each engine into the `src/core` directory.
    *   Refactor engine code to align with the core system's architecture.
    *   Establish communication pipelines between the engines and the core system.
3.  **Phase 3: Rigorous Validation and Verification (Weeks 9-12)**
    *   Develop a comprehensive test suite for each integrated engine.
    *   Conduct unit, integration, and system-level testing.
    *   Perform stress testing and failure analysis.
4.  **Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization (Weeks 13-14)**
    *   Create detailed documentation for each integrated engine.
    *   Update the overall system architecture diagrams.
